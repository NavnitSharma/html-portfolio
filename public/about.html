<h2>Coding love</h2>
<p>Beyond the circuits,you'll find me immersed in the world of coding.<br>
  Turning algorithms into art and embracing the poweer of logic.<br> 
  Lets talk about tech and explore the endless possibilities if coding together.<br>

<h2>Music lover </h2>
<p>
  When the circuits and code need a pause ,I find solace in the rythm of the music.<br>
  From beats to bytes ,there is a harmony in every aspect of life.
